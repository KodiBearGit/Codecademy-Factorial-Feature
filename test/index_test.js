/*2of11 
Follow the steps below to write a test that checks if 120 is equal to Calculate.factorial(5).

Write an assert.equal() statement inside your it block
The first argument in your assert.equal() statement should be Calculate.factorial(5)
The second argument should be 120
Remember to run npm test to see the error message.*/

/*4of11
Refactor part 1

In your index_test.js file, refactor your test code so that it follows the first three phases of a good test.
Setup
Exercise
Verify
 assert.equal(Calculate.factorial(5), 120);

/*5of11
** Get into the red part 2:**

Write another test, with an input other than 5 to put yourself back in the red. This will force you to write implementation code that covers more conditions than just .factorial(5).

You can write a test that checks if your factorial method returns 6 when you pass 3 to .factorial()
*/

/*7of11
Refactor part 2

If you haven’t already done so, make sure that all your test code uses descriptive variables instead of actual numeric values, and make sure that it follows the first three phases of a good test.

Refactor your implementation code so that it is more concise and efficient. This could include cleaning up the existing code, or using a built-in method instead of a for loop for calculating the factorial of any input.

/*8of11 Edge case: test code part 1

In your index_test.js file, write an empty it block with an error message that covers the 0! edge case.
